  Project Requirements for Arduino-powered Oil Dispensing Machine

General Functionality:
 
  Dispensing Options:
      Users can request a specific volume of oil (in liters) or specify an amount in KSH to dispense.
 
  Access Control:
      On powering on, the machine should prompt for a passcode before granting access to the rest of the functionalities. This restricts unauthorized access.
  
  Display and Feedback:
      LCD Screen:
          Show a countdown timer while dispensing.
          Display the final volume dispensed after the dispensing process is complete.
 
  Pricing:
      Currency: KSH.
          Pricing: 1 liter = KSH 230.
 
  Menu Option: Allow changing the price per liter through the menu.
  
  User Interface:
      Buttons:
          Button One: Toggles between entering the desired volume (in liters) and entering the amount (in KSH).
          Button Two: Starts the dispensing sequence. If pressed while dispensing, it stops the operation.
      Keypad:
          Long pressing special characters on the keypad accesses the menu and settings.
  
  Data Management:
      Daily Sales and Volume:
            The system should store the total daily sales and volume dispensed.
            These data can be erased after entering the login password.

  Menu and Settings:
      Access Control:
            A passcode is required to access the menu section.

  Options:
      Change the price per liter.
      Change the passcode.
